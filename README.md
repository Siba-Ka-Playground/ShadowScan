## ⚡ Overview

**ShadowScan** is a recursive reconnaissance tool designed for offensive security operations. Unlike traditional scanners that only look at text, ShadowScan fuses three intelligence domains:

1.  **Code Intelligence (SAST):** Hunts for hardcoded secrets (`AKIA...`), weak configs, and logical flaws.
2.  **Visual Intelligence (OCR/EXIF):** Extracts hidden text and metadata from images.
3.  **Social Intelligence (NLP):** Analyzes sentiment and behavioral patterns to detect insider threats.
